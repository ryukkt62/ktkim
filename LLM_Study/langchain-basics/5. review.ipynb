       "'Here\\'s a classic recipe for making croissants:\\n\\n**Laminating the Dough**\\n\\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups warm milk (around 105°F to 115°F) and 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Sprinkle a pinch of active dry yeast over the mixture and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast becomes frothy.\\n2. Add 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened, to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\\n3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-12 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.\\n4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.\\n\\n**Rolling Out the Dough**\\n\\n5. Punch down the dough and roll it out into a large rectangle, approximately 1/4-inch thick.\\n6. Fold the rectangle in half lengthwise, like a letter, so that the long edges meet. This is called \"folding\" or \"turning.\"\\n7. Rotate the rectangle 90 degrees, so that the folded edge is facing you.\\n\\n**Laminating the Dough**\\n\\n8. Roll out the rectangle again to a large thickness, about 1/4-inch.\\n9. Fold the dough in half lengthwise, like before, and rotate it 90 degrees again.\\n10. Repeat steps 8-9 two more times, for a total of three laminations.\\n\\n**Cutting and Rolling Out the Dough**\\n\\n11. After the third lamination, roll out the dough to a large thickness, about 1/4-inch.\\n12. Cut the dough into long, thin triangles.\\n13. Roll each triangle into a croissant shape, starting from one of the wide ends.\\n\\n**Baking the Croissants**\\n\\n14. Place the croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each pastry.\\n15. Brush the tops of the croissants with egg wash (beaten egg mixed with a little water).\\n16. Bake the croissants in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.\\n\\n**Cooling and Storing**\\n\\n17. Remove the croissants from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes.\\n18. Store the cooled croissants in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.\\n\\nNote: Making croissants requires patience and practice, as the laminating process can be time-consuming. But with persistence and attention to detail, you\\'ll be rewarded with delicious, flaky pastries!'"
